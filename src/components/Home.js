                    Boho is a great way to meet new friends, even while practicing social distancing. When you use Boho,
                    we pick someone else at random and let you talk one-on-one. To help you stay safe, chats are
                    anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not suggested!), and you can stop a chat at any time.
                    Predators have been known to use Boho, so please be careful. If you prefer, you can add your
                    interests, and Boho will look for someone who's into some of the same things as you instead of
                    someone completely random.
